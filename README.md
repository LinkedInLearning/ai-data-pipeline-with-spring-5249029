## Course Description

The lack of data integration is a common blocker preventing organizations from unlocking the power of artificial intelligence. Spring is a popular collection of projects that simplifies data integration and artificial intelligence development for Java applications. In this course, learn how Spring can be used to build data pipelines. Discover how Spring AI makes it easy to use AI models using the Java programming language. Understand how to build data pipelines with Spring Batch and Spring Cloud Streams with RabbitMQ Learn how features within Postgres enable vector databases and machine learning for AI workloads.


## Instructions

The source code for the live demonstrations are available here on the source Github repo. You’re not required to review or build demo applications.  The source code is available as a reference implementation so feel free to explore.


## Installing


The details to run the demonstrations can be found under the docs folder.

## Instructor

Instructor name: Gregory Green`

Being familiar with the Java programming language
will help you get the  most out of those this course.

You should be comfortable with developing Java applications using the maven built tool, along with a integrated developer editors such as intellij.

A having hands-on experience with Spring framework and spring boot will help you better understand some of the examples

You should be comfortable with at least one relational database such as postgres. And should be comfortable with the structure, query, language, or SQL.

Although it’s not required, it is useful it is useful to have experience with messaging system, such as rabbit and Q or similar solutions,  in addition to a basic understanding of docker and  containers.
